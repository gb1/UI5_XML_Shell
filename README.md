Testing out the rough waters of XML Views in SAP UI5 for creating a desktop sap.ui.ux3.Shell type application.

All aboard!

I'm using Sublime with plugins/templates from https://github.com/qmacro/SublimeUI5

To run:
- Add in UI5 libs and modify index.html if needed.
- Run "npm install connect" in root
- Run "node server.js" in root
- open browser to http://127.0.0.1:888
